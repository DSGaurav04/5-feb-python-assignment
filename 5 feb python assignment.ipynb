    "1)Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It allows for the hiding of implementation details and protects the data from external interference.\n",
    "\n",

It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it, allowing users to interact with objects without needing to understand their internal workings.\n",

    "3)Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can acquire the properties (attributes and methods) of another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, where subclasses (derived classes) can inherit from superclasses (base classes) and extend or override their functionality.\n",

It allows different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, enabling code to work with objects of different types through a single interface. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading."
